This route starts and ends flat and fast with some hillier sections in the middle.

Start from the trailhead across from the Marstons Mills Airport. The route tumbles down a hill from the parking lot and crosses Race Ln in an old cattle tunnel. The route climbs up from the tunnel onto the parking lot road for the airport and passes behind a few buildings before turning left into the woods.

The trail winds through some dense trees and brush in the Danforth parcel. The route stays to the right, wrapping around the airport before taking a quick left and climbing steeply up to Popple Bottom Road.

From Popple Bottom Road, the route turns right on Dube Rock Trail and follows this rocky rollercoaster uphill to it's intersection with Crocker Road. The loop turns left onto Crocker Road and quickly right onto a spur trail to the Airport Trail itself. A left onto the Airport Trail brings you back to the Danforth Trail. Follow the route back along the edge of the airport, through the dense brush and trees, back into the cow tunnel, and up the hill to the parking lot.
