I switched from an Apple Watch to a Garmin Forerunner 955 last year and kept getting a small rash under the stock silicone band. When Garmin released their UltraFit Nylon band in spring, I bought it to hopefully solve this problem.

The hook-and-loop design works just like my old Apple Sport Loop. I can adjust it to the right fit for different activities instead of being stuck with fixed holes that don't quite work. After a year of daily wear including trail runs and hikes, the band has held up well with no fraying or loosening of the closure.

The nylon material completely solved my skin irritation issues. It's also easy to clean - just soap and water after muddy runs - and dries quickly.

One unexpected benefit: the band keeps better contact between the heart rate sensor and my wrist, especially when using trekking poles or moving over technical terrain.

While it costs more than third-party options, the durability and comfort have been worth it. Installation is straightforward with the standard quick-release pins.

You can order the band direct from Garmin in whatever size fits your watch here below:
