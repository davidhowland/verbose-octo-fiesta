After years of wearing Apple Watches with their excellent Sport Loop bands, switching to my Garmin Forerunner 955 came with an unexpected challenge - finding a comfortable, adjustable watch band that could handle daily wear and intense outdoor activities. The included silicone band worked fine, but I missed the infinite adjustability and breathability of the Sport Loop style. Last spring, Garmin finally released their UltraFit Nylon band, and it's become my go-to band for everything from trail running to daily wear.

The UltraFit band uses the same hook-and-loop design that made me love the Apple Sport Loop. You can dial in the exact right fit for different activities - a bit looser for all-day comfort at work, slightly tighter for running, or somewhere in between for everything else. This adjustability also means no more fiddling with fixed holes that never quite give you the perfect fit, especially when your wrist size changes throughout the day.

One of my favorite features is how easy it is to clean. After muddy trail runs or sweaty summer hikes, I can simply wash it with soap and water, and it dries quickly. The nylon material has proven much more skin-friendly than the standard elastomer bands - I used to get occasional rashes and irritation with the stock band, especially during humid summer runs, but haven't had any issues with the UltraFit.

While the price point is higher than some third-party options, the durability has justified the cost. After a year of daily wear including countless runs, hikes, and general use, the band shows minimal wear. The hook-and-loop closure is still strong, and the nylon hasn't frayed or lost its shape. Installation was straightforward with the standard quick-release pins - much easier than some aftermarket bands I've tried in the past.

While not perfect, I've noticed an unexpected benefit during activities that involve holding trekking poles. The band's infinite adjustability seems to help maintain better contact between the optical heart rate sensor and my wrist, especially when my wrists are bent up or down while hiking or backcountry skiing. With the stock band, I often saw heart rate dropouts or clearly incorrect readings during these activities, but the UltraFit's ability to fine-tune the fit has noticeably improved the sensor's reliability in these challenging conditions.

You can order the band direct from Garmin in whatever size fits your watch here below:
