## About Cape Cod Trail Running

Cape Cod Trail running started when I moved back to Cape Cod after a few years away. I was rehabbing an ankle injury that meant i couldn't run long miles on the road and needed to be in the woods. I had grown up mountain biking on the trails in Falmouth and Barnstable and started logging miles on the woods on my feet as well. I couldn't find any good resources with routes of various distances so I started creating my own and wanted to share them with other runners.

Cape Cod isn't one of the spots most people think of for trail running or mountain biking. I think our trail networks are very underrated, however, and my goal with Cape Cod Trail Running is to share our fantastic trails and natural areas with more people. The Cape is home to over 1000 miles of sandy, rocky, rooty, hilly trail. Our milder climate means you ran ride and run for almost all of the winter without dealing with much snow or ice. The sandy soil means the trails drain extremely quickly and mud is mostly not a problem. Our local NEMBA chapter is very active working with local towns to maintain and expand our trail networks. If you enjoy the content on this site or the trails on the Cape, please consider making a donation: [https://www.nemba-capecod.org/](https://www.nemba-capecod.org/).

For each suggested route I provide distance, elevation gain, and the list of trails to follow. You can also download a GPX file to import to a Garmin or similar GPS device to follow the route. **Please note that I make no claims about the condition of the trails and all use of the routes and trails mentioned on this site is at your own risk.** If I describe a route or trail on this website, it means I might have had fun running or riding it and that you _might_ have fun as well.
