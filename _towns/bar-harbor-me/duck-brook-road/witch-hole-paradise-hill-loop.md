The carriage roads of Acadia National Park are a paradise for running. Soft and even footing and miles of car-free running make this one of the best places I have ever run. This loop starts at the beautiful Duck Brook Bridge and covers 4.20 miles around Witch Hold Pond and up and around Paradise Hill. Beautiful views, perhaps some wildlife if you start early enough in the day, and some grinding hills at a approachable great - what more could you want?
