This trail is one of the few off-road running options in the northern Outer Banks with decent length. It is almost entirely shaded and stretches just a bit over 4 miles if you run the entire trail out and back. Keep an eye out for deer, rabbits, and a whole host of different birds including ospreys. If you're running in the morning look out for massive spider webs stretching across the trail. Make sure to check out the two observation decks that look out over Currituck Sound.
