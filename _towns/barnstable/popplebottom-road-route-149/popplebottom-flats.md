This is one of my favorite flat and fast routes in the West Barnstable Conservation Area.

To add some mileage and more challenging singletrack trail, you can start this route from the [Otis Atwood](/trailheads/otis-atwood/index/) trailhead and run the 5.5 mile [Popplebottom Flats Extended](/trailheads/otis-atwood/popplebottom-flats-extended/) route.
