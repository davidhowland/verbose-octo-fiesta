This is a great simple trail route in the Otis Atwood Conservation Area. I ran this a ton while building up mileage after an injury and it's a great option for short runs. It's a simple route starting from the Otis Atwood trailhead and following the ```Otis Atwood Trail``` either clockwise or counterclockwise around the conservation area.
