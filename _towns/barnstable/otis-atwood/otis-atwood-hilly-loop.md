The Otis Atwood Hilly Loop packs in a lot of climbing over a relatively short distance from the Otis Atwood trailhead. It includes the two steep climb sections back up to Popple Bottom Road from the airport and the long climb up the Access Road from Popple Bottom Road. This is one of my favorite short runs in Barnstable.
