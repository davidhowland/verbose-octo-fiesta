The Otis Atwood Loop Loop is one of my favorite ~5K trail runs. This double loop is full of punchy hills with some rocks throughout the trail.

Start at the Otis Atwood trailhead on Osterville - West Barnstable Road. Head into the woods to the left and climb through the woods on the eastern half of the ```Otis Atwood Loop Trail```. Take a right at the end of the trail and run past the golf course on your left until the road crossing of Route 149. Cross the road and head into the West Barnstable Conservation Area from the dirt parking lot. Follow the ```Briar Ridge Trail``` and then cross the fire road onto the ```Danforth Trail```. When the ```Danforth Trail``` turns left, stay straight and run up the steep hill to a right onto the ```Airport Trail```. Follow the ```Airport Trail``` to the end at the fire road and turn right to retrace your path on the ```Briar Ridge Trail``` to the parking lot and Route 149. Cross the road and take your first left after the golf course onto the western half of the ```Otis Atwood Loop Trail```. Follow this trail to the end at the trailhead.
