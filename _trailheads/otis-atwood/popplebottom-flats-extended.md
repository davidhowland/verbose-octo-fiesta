This is a longer version of the Popplebottom Flats route that traverses five and a half miles of mostly flat fireroads and wide singletrack. This version starts and ends with the east and west sides of the Otis Atwood Loop trail to add some punchy hills and trickier trails. If you'd like a flatter and easier version of this route, try the 3.4 mile [Popplebottom Flats](/trailheads/popplebottom-road-route-149/popplebottom-flats/).
