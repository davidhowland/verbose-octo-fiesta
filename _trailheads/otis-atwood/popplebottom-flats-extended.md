This is a longer version of the Popplebottom Flats route that traverses five and a half miles of mostly flat fireroads and wide singletrack. This version starts and ends with the east and west sides of the Otis Atwood Loop trail to add some punchy hills and trickier trails.

Start at the Otis Atwood trailhead on Osterville-West Barnstable Road and head left from the parking lot onto the ```Otis Atwood Loop```. At the end of the first half of the loop head straight to cross the back end of the driving range and carefully cross MA Route 149. Enter back into the woods at the parking lot onto ```Briar Ridge```. Cross ```Popple Bottom Road``` and run down the hill onto ```Danforth Trails```. Follow this trail through the plant tunnel, around the edge of the airfield, and into the meadow area on the ```Meadow Trail```. Take a right onto ```Crocker Road``` and then a left onto ```C-O-MM and Get It``` and follow this through to a right onto ```Crooked Cartway```. Follow the fire road until you hit ```Popple Bottom Road``` again and take a right to follow the doubletrack all the way back to ```Briar Ridge``` and cross MA Route 149 back towards the golf course. Take a left up the hill onto the western segment of the ```Otis Atwood Loop``` and run back to the parking lot.
