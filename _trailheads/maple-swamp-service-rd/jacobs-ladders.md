This route is one of my favorite runs in the Maple Swamp Conservation Area. It covers a bit more than three miles and has two big hilly sections. Start off from the parking lot taking ```Sasquatch``` to the right and follow it to the end at the intersection with the bench. Run up the switchbacks of ```The End is Nye``` and then cross the cart path to descend ```Jazz```. At the triangular intersection at the bottom of the hill, take ```Jacob's Schooner``` and run down the tight switchbacks and up the other side. This trail ends at the beginning of ```Jacobs Ladder``` which takes you down a hill to a marshy pond area and then back up a couple of steep hills with wooden steps (the eponymous ladders). Take a left at the end of the trail and run back to the parking lot.
