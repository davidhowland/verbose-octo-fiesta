This route is a quick and hilly option from the Maple Swamp Service Road Trailhead in Sandwich. It climbs 194 feet over two miles (yes, the map officially measures 1.95 miles but I always get two miles on my watch) and then descends back to the parking lot. Follow the ```Sasquatch``` trail to the right out of the parking lot. After .75 miles, take ```The End is Nye``` at the junction with the wooden bench and follow the switchbacks to the top of the hill. Stay to the left onto the doubletrack to the viewing platform at the top of Sam Nyes Mountain. Enjoy the views of Cape Cod Bay if the weather is nice. Return to the parking by continuing past the platform onto ```W S Hill```. Cross another cart path and continue downhill onto ```Jacobs Ladder``` staying left and following the signs back to the parking area.
