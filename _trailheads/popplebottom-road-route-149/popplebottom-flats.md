This is one of my favorite flat and fast routes in the West Barnstable Conservation Area.

Enter the woods at the parking lot onto ```Briar Ridge```. Cross ```Popple Bottom Road``` and run down the hill onto ```Danforth Trails```. Follow this trail through the plant tunnel, around the edge of the airfield, and into the meadow area on the ```Meadow Trail```. Take a right onto ```Crocker Road``` and then a left onto ```C-O-MM and Get It``` and follow this through to a right onto ```Crooked Cartway```. Follow the fire road until you hit ```Popple Bottom Road``` again and take a right to follow the doubletrack all the way back to ```Briar Ridge``` and the parking lot.

To add some mileage and more challenging singletrack trail, you can start this route from the [Otis Atwood](/trailheads/otis-atwood/index/) trailhead and run the 5.5 mile [Popplebottom Flats Extended](/trailheads/otis-atwood/popplebottom-flats-extended/) route.
