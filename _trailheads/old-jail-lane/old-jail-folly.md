This route is a tough loop through the Old Jail Lane Conservation Area. It has several sections of steep single track and a few sections of more sedate double track.

Follow the dirt road out of the trailhead and continue straight past the private residence into the conservation area. Stay left at the fork and then take a right onto ```Central Park```. This is a flowy trail with a few rocks and one giant glacial erratic that the trails cuts right through. At the end of the trail, take a right onto the doubletrack and run down the steep hill and then up the other side to a left turn onto ```Fin's Folly```. Follow the switchbacks back down the hill you just climbed and then back up the steep hill to a left turn onto another section of doubletrack. After a tenth of a mile take a right onto ```Drumlins of Doom``` and follow this to the end. Turn left onto the fire road and follow that straight across the conservation area to a left turn onto ```Mei Li Way```. This is a rollercoaster of a trail with some washed out sections that parallels the highway. At it's end, the trail loops around and spits out onto ```Easy St```. At the four way intersection, take a right onto the doubletrack that will bring you back past ```Central Park``` and straight to the trailhead.
